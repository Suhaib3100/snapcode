# SnapCode

SnapCode is an AI-powered tool that converts screenshots, wireframes, or image snippets into clean, production-ready React or HTML code. Designed for developers and designers, it streamlines the process of turning UI designs into functional frontend components. It also supports Figma export functionality for seamless integration into your design workflow.

## Features
- üñºÔ∏è **Screenshot to Code**: Instantly convert UI images into structured React or HTML code.
- üé® **Wireframe to Code**: Generate clean and responsive code from hand-drawn wireframes.
- üîó **Figma Export Support**: Directly extract and convert Figma designs into working frontend components.
- ‚ö° **AI-Powered Optimization**: Smart detection and refinement for accurate and maintainable code.
- üõ†Ô∏è **Customization & Extensibility**: Modify and fine-tune the output as per your needs.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js (React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS)
- **Backend**: (To be finalized)
- **AI Model**: (To be finalized, likely OpenAI or a custom ML model for image-to-code conversion)

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/snapcode.git
